# Pass 5 — polish (queue; opened 2026-09-02)

*Pass 5 is the wording pass — voice, consistency, cuts. Its inputs: the
on-spec material and wording debt every pass-2 session logged in
[pass2.md](pass2.md)'s hand-off section (written when polish was still
numbered pass 4 — read "pass 4" there as pass 5), and what passes 3 and 4
append here: cuts pass 3 made and why, material it moved, wording it left
rough on purpose because the shape mattered more, and the tics it noticed.
Nothing here is acted on before pass 4 has checked the page.*

## Standing items

- The "not X but Y" construction — pass 2's most common register error,
  Part XIII its worst offender.
- The named-qualifier hedge ("with two exceptions", "five of the seven") —
  right precision, repetitive phrasing.
- One voice sweep against the best page, chosen in pass 5's first session.
- The glossary as the terminology checklist.

## Entries

*(pass-3 and pass-4 sessions append below, newest first: the page, what
was cut or moved, and why)*

- **2026-09-02, session A.** `tickets-and-loading`: the *data it owns*
  inventory is gone — `ChunkHolder.queueLevel`, `ChunkMap.unloadQueue`,
  `ChunkMap.serverViewDistance` and `MIN_VIEW_DISTANCE`, `ChunkMap.playerMap`,
  `ChunkMap.getUpdatingChunkIfPresent`, `ServerPlayer.requestedViewDistance`
  / `chunkTrackingView` / `lastSectionPos`, `PlayerList.viewDistance` /
  `simulationDistance`, `ServerChunkCache.CACHE_SIZE` / `lastChunk`,
  `ServerChunkCache.ticketStorage` are no longer named (reason: the cast
  table replaces the inventory; the class index still answers "where");
  the *Called by* list (teleports and `ServerPlayer.doTick` as callers of
  `ChunkMap.move`, `ForceLoadCommand` → `ServerLevel.setChunkForced` at
  `ChunkMap.FORCED_TICKET_LEVEL` loaded synchronously) and the *Calls into*
  list are cut (reason: interfaces survive as one sentence; the forced
  ticket is in the table). `protocol-phases`: the *Crosses the network as*
  packet list is cut in favour of `reference/packets.md`
  (`ClientboundLoginCompressionPacket` is now unnamed — the compression
  switch is described); the *Data-driven by* bullet (server properties,
  resource-pack settings, data packs) is cut; the *Interfaces* callers are
  folded into one sentence. Wording left rough on purpose: both pilots
  still carry em-dash chains in the decision tables' gate cells, and the
  tickets page says "graph" and "tracker" for the same object.
