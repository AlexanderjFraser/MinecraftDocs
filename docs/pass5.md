# Pass 5 — polish (queue; opened 2026-09-02)

*Pass 5 is the wording pass — voice, consistency, cuts. Its inputs: the
on-spec material and wording debt every pass-2 session logged in
[pass2.md](pass2.md)'s hand-off section (written when polish was still
numbered pass 4 — read "pass 4" there as pass 5), and what passes 3 and 4
append here: cuts pass 3 made and why, material it moved, wording it left
rough on purpose because the shape mattered more, and the tics it noticed.
Nothing here is acted on before pass 4 has checked the page.*

## Standing items

- The "not X but Y" construction — pass 2's most common register error,
  Part XIII its worst offender.
- The named-qualifier hedge ("with two exceptions", "five of the seven") —
  right precision, repetitive phrasing.
- One voice sweep against the best page, chosen in pass 5's first session.
- The glossary as the terminology checklist.

## Entries

*(pass-3 and pass-4 sessions append below, newest first: the page, what
was cut or moved, and why)*

- **2026-09-02, session D — Part III.** Five pages, and the register debt
  pass 2 logged against this part is **paid**: the dozen "not X but Y",
  "two, not one" and "and there is no Z" constructions that made Part III
  the corpus's worst offender are gone, restated positively. The three
  bullets opening with "Two …" are gone with the bullet walls — all five
  pages now carry **zero** bulleted lists between them (the budget allows
  three each), which is worth checking is not its own monotony: the
  material became prose, tables and figures, and pass 5 should look for
  paragraphs that would read better as a short list after all.
  *Cuts and moves, per page.*
  **`server-tick`**: the field inventories go (the `ServerTickRateManager`
  sprint bookkeeping — `remainingSprintTicks`, `sprintTickStartTime`,
  `sprintTimeSpend` — and `MinecraftServer.mayHaveDelayedTasks` as a named
  field are no longer listed, only used); `MinecraftServer.spin` and the
  creation of the Server thread move to `starting-a-server`; the crash
  report, `MinecraftServer.constructOrExtractCrashReport`,
  `MinecraftServer.onServerCrash`, the *finally* and `ServerWatchdog` move
  to `how-a-server-dies`, leaving a pointer; `Minecraft.packetProcessor`
  (the client's copy) is left to Part X; `TickRateManager` living in
  `ClientLevel` too is left to `anatomy`, which already says it; the
  *Interfaces* and *Data-driven by* blocks dissolve into the cast row, the
  `tickChildren` table and the questions. The `SampleLogger` /
  `TpsDebugDimensions` paragraph pass 2 flagged as a cut candidate
  **survives**, now inside the bookkeeping section — pass 5 should decide
  again with the page in front of it.
  **`server-level-tick`**: the field inventory and the thirteen-step
  narration go as structures, every fact re-placed; `BlockEventData` and the
  `ServerLevel.customSpawners` / `dragonFight` / `raids` / `sleepStatus`
  fields are no longer named as fields. `ServerChunkCache.onLightUpdate`'s
  off-thread hop is **moved** to `../world/lighting.md`, which already
  narrates it in full (checked). The "Exception ticking world" crash wrapper
  moves to `server-tick`; the `GameRules` package-move note and the
  *DO_DAYLIGHT_CYCLE* / *DO_MOB_SPAWNING* renames move to
  `../world/level-data-and-rules.md`. The pass-2 guard bookkeeping spread
  across six narrated steps is now the flowchart, which is what pass 2
  predicted would let it be cut.
  **`players-and-sessions`**: the `PlayerList` and `ServerPlayer` field
  inventories go. **Three items need a home and have none yet** — the
  `ServerPlayerGameMode` paragraph (block-breaking state,
  `ServerPlayerGameMode.changeGameModeForPlayer`,
  `ServerPlayer.storeGameTypes`), which belongs with `player-anatomy` or a
  game-mode page; `ClientboundSetChunkCacheRadiusPacket` /
  `ClientboundSetSimulationDistancePacket` on a view-distance change, which
  is server reconfiguration rather than a session event (candidate home:
  `what-the-client-is-told`); and `PlayerDataStorage`'s *.dat_old* and
  *corrupted* rescue, compressed here into one cast-table cell and wanting a
  save-format Reference entry. The `ClientboundSetHealthPacket`
  saturation-crossing detail moves to `player-anatomy` by reference; the
  login state machine, the 600-tick login timeout, the auth thread and
  `CommonListenerCookie`'s travel move to `protocol-phases`, linked; the
  permission model is one sentence and a link to `brigadier-and-commands`
  (pass 2 asked session K to check the two had not drifted — they no longer
  can).
  **`starting-a-server`** (was `server-lifecycle`): the field inventories
  go; everything about stopping — `MinecraftServer.halt`, the *finally*, the
  save model, `Util.shutdownExecutors`, the lock release, the three endings,
  the crash-report machinery — moves to `how-a-server-dies`. Only
  `CrashReport.preload` stays, because it happens at boot. The side threads
  became a four-column table (thread · made by · daemon · what it may
  touch), which is the enumerative-beyond-seven rule doing its job.
  *Wording left rough on purpose.* All five pages end their opening
  paragraph on a bolded or dashed sentence — one voice, five times, and the
  same tic session C logged for Part II; a corpus-wide look belongs in pass
  5's voice sweep rather than in any one part. `how-a-server-dies` uses
  *the number* device twice (**Ten seconds**, and the comparison table's
  "differ in one cell") where once is the convention. `server-tick`'s
  *Questions players ask* was trimmed to four questions by moving the
  profiler answer into the bookkeeping section and the worker-crash answer
  into the event-loop section, which is where both belonged; the remaining
  four are the ones a player would actually ask. Part III now has five
  pages where pass 2 had four, so the part is longer, not shorter — the
  length bill for it comes due here.

- **2026-09-02, session A.** `tickets-and-loading`: the *data it owns*
  inventory is gone — `ChunkHolder.queueLevel`, `ChunkMap.unloadQueue`,
  `ChunkMap.serverViewDistance` and `MIN_VIEW_DISTANCE`, `ChunkMap.playerMap`,
  `ChunkMap.getUpdatingChunkIfPresent`, `ServerPlayer.requestedViewDistance`
  / `chunkTrackingView` / `lastSectionPos`, `PlayerList.viewDistance` /
  `simulationDistance`, `ServerChunkCache.CACHE_SIZE` / `lastChunk`,
  `ServerChunkCache.ticketStorage` are no longer named (reason: the cast
  table replaces the inventory; the class index still answers "where");
  the *Called by* list (teleports and `ServerPlayer.doTick` as callers of
  `ChunkMap.move`, `ForceLoadCommand` → `ServerLevel.setChunkForced` at
  `ChunkMap.FORCED_TICKET_LEVEL` loaded synchronously) and the *Calls into*
  list are cut (reason: interfaces survive as one sentence; the forced
  ticket is in the table). `protocol-phases`: the *Crosses the network as*
  packet list is cut in favour of `reference/packets.md`
  (`ClientboundLoginCompressionPacket` is now unnamed — the compression
  switch is described); the *Data-driven by* bullet (server properties,
  resource-pack settings, data packs) is cut; the *Interfaces* callers are
  folded into one sentence. Wording left rough on purpose: both pilots
  still carry em-dash chains in the decision tables' gate cells, and the
  tickets page says "graph" and "tracker" for the same object.


- **2026-09-02, session C — Parts I and II.** Cuts are names, not claims,
  unless marked; the class index still answers "where" for every name here.
  **`anatomy`**: the eleven-row thread table and the situational-threads
  paragraph moved to `reference/threads.md` (already there, verified);
  `Minecraft`'s manager inventory retired (`TextureManager`, `ShaderManager`,
  `ModelManager`, `AtlasManager`, `FontManager`, `SoundManager`,
  `GameRenderer`, `LevelRenderer`, `EntityRenderDispatcher`,
  `BlockEntityRenderDispatcher`, `ParticleEngine`, `MouseHandler`,
  `KeyboardHandler`) and `MinecraftServer`'s (`ServerFunctionManager`,
  `TimerQueue`, `ServerClockManager` — the rest are on `server-tick`); the
  stale-`TickTask`, "Can't keep up!" and flush-bracket invariants cut to a
  link to `server-tick`, which states them; "the server is the game; the
  client is a view of it" and the "this page is the frame" meta-sentence
  cut (the landing page says it); `RconThread`, `QueryThreadGs4`,
  `ManagementServer` dropped from *Where to look*.
  **`what-this-book-skips`**: "Seventy-six pages cover the game" cut (the
  count churns); the four gap lists folded into one table with two prose
  paragraphs for the three entries that needed more than a cell; the four
  "the honest version" / "the detail worth having" tics rephrased.
  **`codecs-nbt-json`**: cut names — `ExtraCodecs.intRange` /
  `nonEmptyList` / `optionalAlwaysPresentFieldOf`, `TagTypes`,
  `NbtIo.readCompressed`, `NbtOps.convertTo`, the three printing visitors
  and the `/data` colouring aside, the five `nbt/visitors` classes,
  `ValueOutput.TypedOutputList`, `StreamEncoder` / `StreamDecoder`,
  `ByteBufCodecs.VAR_INT` / `STRING_UTF8` / `registry` / `holderSet` and
  the `…Trusted` variants, "up to twelve field codecs", `RegionFileVersion`'s
  GZIP/LZ4/none roster; the caller inventory (`PlayerDataStorage`,
  `LevelStorageSource`, `SavedDataStorage`, `SavedDataType`,
  `CommandStorage`, the three NBT command arguments, `Entity.saveWithoutId`
  / `load`); moved to links: the `ComponentSerialization` matrix
  (`text-components`), the `RegistrySynchronization` case
  (`protocol-phases`), `CODEC_WITH_BOUND_COMPONENTS` (`data-components`),
  `RemoteSlot`'s either-or (`containers-and-menus`).
  **`identifiers-and-registries`**: `MappedRegistry.byValue` cut;
  `TagLoader` named only as `TagLoader.buildUpdatedLookups`.
  **`resource-system`**: `RegistryDataLoader` dropped from its calls-into
  (the registries page owns it). **`tags`**: nothing cut.
  **`data-components`**: the hashing detail (`HashedStack`,
  `HashedPatchMap`, `RemoteSlot.Synchronized`'s either-or and promotion,
  the creative double guard) moved to `codecs-nbt-json` and
  `containers-and-menus`; three enchanting facts moved *towards* Part VII
  and **not yet present there** — "if the prototype lacks `ENCHANTMENTS`
  the `updateEnchantments` write is skipped", "`clickMenuButton` consumes
  lapis and fires `CriteriaTriggers.ENCHANTED_ITEM`", "`/enchant` is the
  same tail after `Enchantment.canEnchant` and a compatibility check" —
  session H absorbs them into `enchantments`; `RegistryDataCollector`'s
  client-only status no longer stated; `EnchantmentHelper`,
  `ItemEnchantments`, `RemoteSlot`, `HashedStack`, `HashOps` dropped from
  *Where to look*. **`chat-and-signing`**: the `Component` section
  replaced by a pointer paragraph; "new-shaped in 26.2" cut (rule 3).
  Wording left rough on purpose: the seven Part II hooks all end their
  opening paragraph on a bold or dashed sentence — one voice, seven times;
  the comparison and pattern pages carry long table cells that pass 5 may
  want as prose; `what-this-book-skips` still says "the part that
  surprises" where it used to say "the fact worth knowing".

- **2026-09-02, session B — maps.** The four atlas pages and the atlas
  front page are new prose and carry the em-dash chains the corpus is
  prone to; `packages.md`'s part → packages table will duplicate the
  landing pages once all thirteen exist and is a candidate cut then;
  `hierarchy.md`'s *two trees the table shows and the figures do not* is a
  two-sentence section and should either grow a figure or fold into the
  tables' preamble; "the number" device is used once (`biggest.md`) —
  check it reads as intended. Nothing was cut from the old maps: the
  tables are all still there under the figures, at the same URLs.
