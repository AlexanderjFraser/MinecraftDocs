# Pass 5 — polish (queue; opened 2026-09-02)

*Pass 5 is the wording pass — voice, consistency, cuts. Its inputs: the
on-spec material and wording debt every pass-2 session logged in
[pass2.md](pass2.md)'s hand-off section (written when polish was still
numbered pass 4 — read "pass 4" there as pass 5), and what passes 3 and 4
append here: cuts pass 3 made and why, material it moved, wording it left
rough on purpose because the shape mattered more, and the tics it noticed.
Nothing here is acted on before pass 4 has checked the page.*

## Standing items

- The "not X but Y" construction — pass 2's most common register error,
  Part XIII its worst offender.
- The named-qualifier hedge ("with two exceptions", "five of the seven") —
  right precision, repetitive phrasing.
- One voice sweep against the best page, chosen in pass 5's first session.
- The glossary as the terminology checklist.

## Entries

*(pass-3 and pass-4 sessions append below, newest first: the page, what
was cut or moved, and why)*

- **2026-09-02, session A.** `tickets-and-loading`: the *data it owns*
  inventory is gone — `ChunkHolder.queueLevel`, `ChunkMap.unloadQueue`,
  `ChunkMap.serverViewDistance` and `MIN_VIEW_DISTANCE`, `ChunkMap.playerMap`,
  `ChunkMap.getUpdatingChunkIfPresent`, `ServerPlayer.requestedViewDistance`
  / `chunkTrackingView` / `lastSectionPos`, `PlayerList.viewDistance` /
  `simulationDistance`, `ServerChunkCache.CACHE_SIZE` / `lastChunk`,
  `ServerChunkCache.ticketStorage` are no longer named (reason: the cast
  table replaces the inventory; the class index still answers "where");
  the *Called by* list (teleports and `ServerPlayer.doTick` as callers of
  `ChunkMap.move`, `ForceLoadCommand` → `ServerLevel.setChunkForced` at
  `ChunkMap.FORCED_TICKET_LEVEL` loaded synchronously) and the *Calls into*
  list are cut (reason: interfaces survive as one sentence; the forced
  ticket is in the table). `protocol-phases`: the *Crosses the network as*
  packet list is cut in favour of `reference/packets.md`
  (`ClientboundLoginCompressionPacket` is now unnamed — the compression
  switch is described); the *Data-driven by* bullet (server properties,
  resource-pack settings, data packs) is cut; the *Interfaces* callers are
  folded into one sentence. Wording left rough on purpose: both pilots
  still carry em-dash chains in the decision tables' gate cells, and the
  tickets page says "graph" and "tracker" for the same object.


- **2026-09-02, session C — Parts I and II.** Cuts are names, not claims,
  unless marked; the class index still answers "where" for every name here.
  **`anatomy`**: the eleven-row thread table and the situational-threads
  paragraph moved to `reference/threads.md` (already there, verified);
  `Minecraft`'s manager inventory retired (`TextureManager`, `ShaderManager`,
  `ModelManager`, `AtlasManager`, `FontManager`, `SoundManager`,
  `GameRenderer`, `LevelRenderer`, `EntityRenderDispatcher`,
  `BlockEntityRenderDispatcher`, `ParticleEngine`, `MouseHandler`,
  `KeyboardHandler`) and `MinecraftServer`'s (`ServerFunctionManager`,
  `TimerQueue`, `ServerClockManager` — the rest are on `server-tick`); the
  stale-`TickTask`, "Can't keep up!" and flush-bracket invariants cut to a
  link to `server-tick`, which states them; "the server is the game; the
  client is a view of it" and the "this page is the frame" meta-sentence
  cut (the landing page says it); `RconThread`, `QueryThreadGs4`,
  `ManagementServer` dropped from *Where to look*.
  **`what-this-book-skips`**: "Seventy-six pages cover the game" cut (the
  count churns); the four gap lists folded into one table with two prose
  paragraphs for the three entries that needed more than a cell; the four
  "the honest version" / "the detail worth having" tics rephrased.
  **`codecs-nbt-json`**: cut names — `ExtraCodecs.intRange` /
  `nonEmptyList` / `optionalAlwaysPresentFieldOf`, `TagTypes`,
  `NbtIo.readCompressed`, `NbtOps.convertTo`, the three printing visitors
  and the `/data` colouring aside, the five `nbt/visitors` classes,
  `ValueOutput.TypedOutputList`, `StreamEncoder` / `StreamDecoder`,
  `ByteBufCodecs.VAR_INT` / `STRING_UTF8` / `registry` / `holderSet` and
  the `…Trusted` variants, "up to twelve field codecs", `RegionFileVersion`'s
  GZIP/LZ4/none roster; the caller inventory (`PlayerDataStorage`,
  `LevelStorageSource`, `SavedDataStorage`, `SavedDataType`,
  `CommandStorage`, the three NBT command arguments, `Entity.saveWithoutId`
  / `load`); moved to links: the `ComponentSerialization` matrix
  (`text-components`), the `RegistrySynchronization` case
  (`protocol-phases`), `CODEC_WITH_BOUND_COMPONENTS` (`data-components`),
  `RemoteSlot`'s either-or (`containers-and-menus`).
  **`identifiers-and-registries`**: `MappedRegistry.byValue` cut;
  `TagLoader` named only as `TagLoader.buildUpdatedLookups`.
  **`resource-system`**: `RegistryDataLoader` dropped from its calls-into
  (the registries page owns it). **`tags`**: nothing cut.
  **`data-components`**: the hashing detail (`HashedStack`,
  `HashedPatchMap`, `RemoteSlot.Synchronized`'s either-or and promotion,
  the creative double guard) moved to `codecs-nbt-json` and
  `containers-and-menus`; three enchanting facts moved *towards* Part VII
  and **not yet present there** — "if the prototype lacks `ENCHANTMENTS`
  the `updateEnchantments` write is skipped", "`clickMenuButton` consumes
  lapis and fires `CriteriaTriggers.ENCHANTED_ITEM`", "`/enchant` is the
  same tail after `Enchantment.canEnchant` and a compatibility check" —
  session H absorbs them into `enchantments`; `RegistryDataCollector`'s
  client-only status no longer stated; `EnchantmentHelper`,
  `ItemEnchantments`, `RemoteSlot`, `HashedStack`, `HashOps` dropped from
  *Where to look*. **`chat-and-signing`**: the `Component` section
  replaced by a pointer paragraph; "new-shaped in 26.2" cut (rule 3).
  Wording left rough on purpose: the seven Part II hooks all end their
  opening paragraph on a bold or dashed sentence — one voice, seven times;
  the comparison and pattern pages carry long table cells that pass 5 may
  want as prose; `what-this-book-skips` still says "the part that
  surprises" where it used to say "the fact worth knowing".

- **2026-09-02, session B — maps.** The four atlas pages and the atlas
  front page are new prose and carry the em-dash chains the corpus is
  prone to; `packages.md`'s part → packages table will duplicate the
  landing pages once all thirteen exist and is a candidate cut then;
  `hierarchy.md`'s *two trees the table shows and the figures do not* is a
  two-sentence section and should either grow a figure or fold into the
  tables' preamble; "the number" device is used once (`biggest.md`) —
  check it reads as intended. Nothing was cut from the old maps: the
  tables are all still there under the figures, at the same URLs.
